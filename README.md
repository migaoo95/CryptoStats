# About CryptoStats
CryptoStats is a cryptocurrency web-based application developed to accurately trace price movement of various cryptocurrencies and enable users to track their holdings value based of various assets which are usually spread between many currency exchanges.  
#### DashBoard  
- Build in order to allow users to track price movement of various cryptocurrencies. 
#### WatchList 
- Allows users to save their favourite currencies which are stored in LocalStorage for future price movement tracking.
#### Portfolio 
- Build in order to enable users to specify their cryptocurrency holding which are then calculated based on currency current price and displayed within the tab. Additionally specified data is saved within LocalStorage and summed in order to estimate total value of users holdings. 
# Technologies used for this project
#### CoinGeko API
- Available for free coingeko API have allowed me to retrieve most up to day cryptocurrency data that enabled me to develop various user interactions around it.
#### JavaScript 
- For this project i have decided to use vanilla JavaScript to further cement my knowledge of fundamental concepts based around this language.
#### Charts.JS 
- A JavaScript Library that have enabled me to visually display and translate API cryptocurrency price data points into a good looking chart with price crosshair price tracing capabilities.
#### BootStrap 
- I have chosen this framework based on how fast i was able to create clean looking feel of this application which have helped me to direct my focus on Logic and Interactivity of JS.

# Development process and what i have learned 
The entire application was built around classes that allowed me to encapsulate properties and functionalities of each Tab. Bootstrap enable me to realize different ways to diverting my focus more towards logic and interaction which JavaScript has to offer. As i am writing this README long after this application have been developed i have since discover and became efficient in React and tailwind which could help me to develop a same application in much more efficient and better performing manner.
